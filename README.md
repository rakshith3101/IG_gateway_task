# Emolnt
I would like to thank IG Gateway team for providing this opportunity for letting me light up on my cons and pros while working on such cutting edge application. Since the CodaLab is not accepting new submission for the old competitions, I've used google colab to build the model. 

# HOW TO RUN THE NOTEBOOK?
Step 1: Open the ipynb file present in the repo, click on Open in colab.

Step 2: Click on Connect to connect with the runtime.

Step 3: click on Runtime->Run_all.( As the data is imported directly from the site , it is not necessary to import data manually).

I know that the approach and the model which I built might not be outstanding, I being a self learner have grinded pretty much to make the model more optimal. Regardless the model's performance i've learned things which I thought I knew and tried providing a new perspective to the problem. I believe the right way of learning things is to unlearn  and if the table is looking for someone who is really interested in learning and contributing, I align perfectly for this role. I am eager to bring this skill set to your team and contribute to the success of IG Gateway.
